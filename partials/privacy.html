	  <h2>	    The Big Picture</h2>
<p>
	    We are committed to the privacy of our visitors. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
	   <p> Here is how we handle information about your visit. When you browse through this website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store information such as the following concerning your visit:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> The Internet domain (for example, &quot;xcompany.com&quot; if you use a private Internet access account, or &quot;yourschool.edu&quot; if you connect from a university's domain</li>
	      <li>Your IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;</li>
	      <li> The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;</li>
	      <li> The date and time you access our site;</li>
	      <li> The pages you visit; and</li>
	      <li> If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website.
	        </h2>
	          </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>We use this information to help us tailor our site to visitors—to learn about the number of visitors to our site, how visitors are coming to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.</p>
	    <h2> Information Protection</h2>
	     <p> For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.</p>
	      <h2>Information That You Voluntarily Provide</h2>
	       <p> We do not collect personally-identifiable information unless you choose to provide it to us. If you provide us with personally identifiable information, for example by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting it through our website, we use that information only to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information and services that you request.
          </p>	    
         
	      <p>Submitting voluntary information constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the stated purpose. When a user clicks the &quot;Submit&quot; button on any of the Web forms found on our site they are indicating voluntary consent to use of the information they submit for the stated purpose. We do not collect or use information for commercial marketing.</p>
	      <h2>How Information is Used</h2>
	        <p>The information we collect is used for a variety of purposes. We make every effort to disclose clearly how information is used at the point where it is collected so that our users can determine for themselves whether they wish to provide the information.</p>
	        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
	        We may share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances, such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit. Before you submit personally identifiable information, such as on an online form, you will be advised as to the purpose and how the information will be used.
	          </p>
              
	       
          <p>We may also share information collected during your visit with non-federal entities, but only if your inquiry requires accessing data from that external entity. All of our sites that require such external access will be clearly identified to help you make an informed choice.</p>
	  <p>Specifically, information collected during your visit may be shared with the following specific non-governmental entities:</p>
	  <p><strong>Google</strong>. We use Google.com to parse RSS feeds from social media outlets that the program uses.  These feeds allow us to give real-time updates from our twitter feed, our youtube channel and our WordPress feed (among others).	    </p>
	  <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
	   <p> We destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was provided has been fulfilled unless we are required to keep it longer by statute or official policy. Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases information submitted to us may become an agency record and therefore might be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request.</p >
	    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
	    <p>This site may have links to the websites of other federal agencies. There may be links to private organizations, with their permission. Once you go to another site, you are subject to the privacy and security policies of the new site. It is always a good idea to read the Privacy Policy of any website that you visit. teacheratsea.noaa.gov does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained in a linked site. We also do not endorse the organizations or individuals maintaining sites that we link to, any views they express, or any products/services they offer.</p>
	    <h2>Cookies</h2>
	    <p>&quot;Cookies&quot; are small bits of text that are either used for the duration of a session (&quot;session cookies&quot;), or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on to a website (&quot;persistent cookies&quot;). This website does not use persistent cookies or any other persistent tracking technology. However, this site does use Google Analytics, a tool that provides basic information about website visitors.

	 	<h2> Local Storage</h2>
	 	  <p>To allow website users to add resources to favorites and email them, this site uses a feature of HTML5 called “Local Storage.” This feature creates a storage file on the user’s local hard drive that holds links to the resources from this website that the individual user identifies as a favorite. No information from this file is transferred to NOAA or any other website. This file can be cleared at any time by pressing the the <img src='/images/dyk/trash.png' class='no-border' width='12' height='12' alt='delete favorites'/> button on your Favorite Resources page.</p><p>Your data will only be accessible in the browser you are using currently.
